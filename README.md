# Simulink_LiveNegativeView

I used SimuLink to generate a simple android Application within the click of a button!
This app takes the live feed from the camera and converts it into a negative version of itself.

To make this work, use the simulink file added here, and open it with Matlab Simulink as a project
To deploy, click on the Deploy to hardware button, by which the program gets added to your phone.
The phone needs to be connected by USB Debugging mode. 
Also, ensure you have the USB driver and Android Studio in your system.
